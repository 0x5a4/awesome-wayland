CONTRIBUTING
============

Do you want to contribute? We'd love that.

Our goal is to have mostly projects that are stable and useful to many users.

HOW?
----

The easiest way is to go to [the README](https://github.com/rcalixte/awesome-wayland/blob/master/README.md) and click on the "pen" icon in the upper right corner. Make the changes to the file and follow the instructions to create a pull request.

If you want to add an entry to the `README.md` please consider this:

* Is the entry valuable to people trying to get things done in Wayland?
* If you want to add something, please use the template `[YYY](https://github.com/XXX/YYY) â€” DESCRIPTION`
* Please pay attention to the alphabetical ordering and badge structure for languages.

REMOVING PROJECTS
-----------------

We don't remove projects unless they are outright broken, archived, or pronounced deprecated/unmaintained by another project or by the author.
